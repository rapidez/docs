# Installation

[[toc]]

## Requirements

- [Laravel requirements](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/deployment#server-requirements)
- PHP >= 8.2
- MySQL >= 8.0.28
- Elasticsearch Basic >= 8.11
- Magento >= 2.4.7 installation with [flat tables enabled](#flat-tables) ([or use a demo shop](#demo-magento-2-webshop))

::: tip Elasticsearch Basic
There are multiple Elasticsearch versions and licenses, see the [subscriptions page](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions). Rapidez requires at least the basic version which is free but not always installed by default. Make sure you use the "full" or "non-OSS" version otherwise you'll get "no handler for type flattened" errors while [indexing](indexer.md).
:::

## Install Rapidez

1. **Start a fresh project**
```
composer create-project rapidez/rapidez:^3.0 yourproject
```

2. **Add the Magento 2 credentials**

When you have a Magento 2 installation running, add the URL and database credentials to the `.env`. Have a look at the [configuration docs](configuration.md) for all options. If you don't have a Magento installation running yet, we'll set one up for you with Docker from the install command.

3. **Run the install command**

```
php artisan rapidez:install
```

4. **Explore**

Visit Rapidez within your browser! ðŸš€ Plenty of options there:

- [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/)
- [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/valet)
- `php artisan serve`

::: details Use in an existing Laravel project
The `rapidez/rapidez` repository contains a fresh Laravel installation with the Rapidez Core and some other packages installed to give you a good start. If you have an existing project or want to start from scratch, you can install the Rapidez packages yourself. Just have a look at the `composer.json`
:::

::: tip Magento module
Rapidez has a Companion Magento module available called [Rapidez_Compadre](https://github.com/rapidez/magento2-compadre)
This is in no way required but adds additional functionality that we found lacking in Magento.
Current functionality can be found [here](https://github.com/rapidez/magento2-compadre#current-functionality)
:::

::: warning Product image speed
The first time product images will load slowly as they are resized on the fly. Have a look at the [Image Resizer](https://github.com/rapidez/image-resizer) package to read how this is working.

## CORS

### Magento

Rapidez is making AJAX requests to the Magento API which requires CORS to be opened.
- To do so with Laravel Valet, see [this](https://gist.github.com/poul-kg/b669a76fc27afcc31012aa0b0e34f738) and for Valet+, see [this](https://github.com/weprovide/valet-plus/issues/493).
- With the Docker Magento installation, it's already opened [with a patch](https://github.com/michielgerritsen/magento2-extension-integration-test/blob/master/magento/patches/cors.patch).
- For production, you have to restrict this to your domain within your webserver configuration or with, for example, this [Magento 2 CORS module](https://github.com/graycoreio/magento2-cors).

### Elasticsearch

If you're using your own Elasticsearch installation, you have to open CORS in `elasticsearch.yml` and restart Elasticsearch. An example can be found in the project: [`elasticsearch.yml`](https://github.com/rapidez/rapidez/blob/master/elasticsearch.yml). That configuration is used when you're using Elasticsearch from the [Docker Compose config](https://github.com/rapidez/rapidez/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).

## Flat tables

The flat tables need to be enabled in Magento because Rapidez needs them to easily query for products and categories. You can follow [this guide](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/catalog/catalog-flat.html#step-1-enable-the-flat-catalog) to enable it. After that, you need to make sure the [Storefront Properties](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/stores/attributes-product.html#storefront-properties) are configured correctly for all your attributes. You can validate the settings with `php artisan rapidez:validate`. If the result is that some attributes are not in the flat table, you can enable "Used in Product Listing" on them and validate again.

::: warning Public attribute values
All attributes with "Used in Product Listing" enabled will be indexed into Elasticsearch. As this index is publicly available, you should be careful with attributes that contain "sensitive" data (for example, sale counts).
:::

Finally, when your settings are validated, you should [run the Magento indexes](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-index.html#config-cli-subcommands-index-reindex). For example, with `bin/magento indexer:reindex` from your Magento installation.

::: details Row size too large?
If you run into "row size too large" MySQL errors when indexing in Magento, then you could install the [magento2-optimizeflattable](https://github.com/justbetter/magento2-optimizeflattable) module. If you're still running into errors, you should disable the "Used in Product Listing" on "Text field" and "Multiple Select" attributes, one by one until the index is running fine.
:::

## Multistore

When you have set up multiple stores in Magento, Rapidez needs to know which store to show. Rapidez listens to the `MAGE_RUN_CODE` like Magento does. You will have to set that variable from your webserver.

With Nginx, you could use a map, for example:

```nginx
map $http_host $MAGE_RUN_CODE {
    default default_store_code;
    second-store.com second_store_code;
    thrid-store.com third_store_code;
}
```

And pass that to PHP-FPM:
```nginx
fastcgi_param MAGE_RUN_CODE $MAGE_RUN_CODE;
```

## Demo Magento 2 webshop

If you do not have a Magento 2 installation yet, you want to test Rapidez, or like to develop with a fresh Magento 2 installation, you can use a Magento 2 and Elasticsearch installation in a Docker container.

::: tip
Make sure Docker can use at least 4GB of memory!
:::

```
docker-compose up -d
docker exec rapidez_magento magerun2 indexer:reindex
```
Edit the `.env`

```
